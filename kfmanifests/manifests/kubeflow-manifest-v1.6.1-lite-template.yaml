                          specifying sys.example.com will be selected over one specifying

                          the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected.
                          If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier
                          in the list will be selected.

    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average.
    # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
    # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 ⇒ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.
    # NOTE: that this value does not affect actual number of concurrent requests
    #       the user container may receive, but only the average number of requests
    #       that the revision pods will receive.
    container-concurrency-target-percentage: "70"

    # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for the
    # Revision and the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
    # When revision explicitly specifies container concurrency, that value
    # will be used as a scaling target for autoscaler.
    # When specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
    # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
    # This is what we call "soft limit" in the documentation, i.e. it only
    # affects number of pods and does not affect the number of requests
    # individual pod processes.
    # The value must be a positive number such that the value multiplied
    # by container-concurrency-target-percentage is greater than 0.01.
    # NOTE: that this value will be adjusted by application of
    #       container-concurrency-target-percentage, i.e. by default
    #       the system will target on average 70 concurrent requests
    #       per revision pod.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    container-concurrency-target-default: "100"

    # The requests per second (RPS) target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when RPS is used as the scaling metric for a Revision and
    # the Revision specifies unlimited RPS. Even when specifying unlimited RPS,
    # the autoscaler will horizontally scale the application based on this
    # target RPS.
    # Must be greater than 1.0.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    requests-per-second-target-default: "200"

    # The target burst capacity specifies the size of burst in concurrent
    # requests that the system operator expects the system will receive.
    # Autoscaler will try to protect the system from queueing by introducing
    # Activator in the request path if the current spare capacity of the
    # service is less than this setting.
    # If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request path only
    # when the revision is scaled to 0.
    # If this setting is > 0 and container-concurrency-target-percentage is
    # 100% or 1.0, then activator will always be in the request path.
    # -1 denotes unlimited target-burst-capacity and activator will always
    # be in the request path.
    # Other negative values are invalid.
    target-burst-capacity: "200"

    # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
    # average concurrency over the stable window.
    # Stable window must be in whole seconds.

    1. Do not use kubectl to edit this configmap, because some values are used
    during kustomize build. Instead, change the configmap and apply the entire
    kustomize manifests again.
    2. After updating the configmap, some deployments may need to be restarted
    until the changes take effect. A quick way to restart all deployments in a
    namespace: `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n <your-namespace>`.
